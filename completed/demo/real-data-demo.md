5. **Export** â†’ "Export as CSV"
6. **Expected columns**: Date, Query, Clicks, Impressions, Position

### 2. Prepare Demo CSV
```bash
# Typical GSC export will have these columns:
# Date,Query,Clicks,Impressions,Position

# Example content:
2024-10-01,ai tools,45,2500,2.1

   - Click volume (louder notes)
   - Impression volume (longer note durations)

### 4. Generate Shareable MIDI
1. **After playback** completes, click "Download MIDI ðŸŽ¹"
2. **Import** MIDI into GarageBand, Logic, or any DAW
3. **Add** basic drums, bass, or effects if desired
4. **Bounce** to MP3 (20-30 seconds is sufficient)

```html
<!-- Example for Lovable hero section -->
<div class="serp-radio-demo">
    <h2>ðŸŽµ Hear Your SEO Data</h2>
    <p>This 20-second audio was generated from real GSC data:</p>
    
    <audio controls preload="metadata">
        <source src="serp-radio-demo.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Your browser doesn't support audio playback.
    </audio>
    
    <small>Generated from 90 days of search performance data</small>
</div>
```

## Demo Script for Stakeholders

### Opening (30 seconds)
*"What you're about to hear is 90 days of actual search performance data from [client name]. Each note represents a keyword ranking, with pitch indicating position and volume representing click-through performance."*

### During Playback (20 seconds)
*"The higher, brighter notes are top-performing keywords. The volume tells us click velocity. You can actually hear the difference between branded terms and competitive keywords."*

### Closing (10 seconds)
*"This is live CSV upload - any GSC export or rank tracker file becomes instant audio feedback. Perfect for client presentations or internal performance reviews."*

## Expected Impact

### For Investors:
- âœ… **Immediate comprehension** of complex data relationships
- âœ… **Unique positioning** vs traditional dashboards
- âœ… **"Wow factor"** demonstrates innovation
- âœ… **Practical application** shows B2B revenue potential

### For Beta Users:
- âœ… **Quick performance assessment** without reading numbers

## Production Tips

### Best GSC Exports for Demo:
- **Time Range**: 90 days (good balance of data volume/relevance)
- **Include**: High-traffic branded terms + competitive keywords
- **Avoid**: Super long-tail (creates noise in sonification)
- **Size**: 1,000-5,000 rows ideal for 30-60 second audio

### Audio Post-Production:
- **Length**: Keep under 30 seconds for attention span
- **Volume**: Normalize to -14 LUFS for consistent playback
- **Format**: MP3 320kbps for web, WAV for presentations
- **Fade**: Add 1-second fade in/out for smooth looping

### Presentation Context:
- **Lead with problem**: "SEO reporting is overwhelming"
- **Demo the solution**: Play the audio
- **Show the process**: Upload â†’ Listen â†’ Download
- **Close with vision**: "Imagine every client call starting with this"

## Sample Demo Files

Place these in `/demo/samples/`:
- `sample-gsc-export.csv` (sanitized real data)
- `demo-audio-output.mp3` (rendered result)
- `demo-midi-file.mid` (downloadable version)

This creates a complete "input â†’ process â†’ output" demo package that stakeholders can experience end-to-end.
