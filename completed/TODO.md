# üéµ SERP Loop Radio - TODO Checklist

## üîß Immediate Actions Needed

### 1. Install Dependencies & Setup Environment

- [ ] **Install Docker Desktop** (if not already installed)
- [ ] **Install Node.js 18+** (if not already installed)
- [ ] **Copy environment template**: `cp env.template .env`
- [ ] **Configure basic settings** for testing (see QUICKSTART.md)

### 2. Fix React TypeScript Issues (Optional)

The React app has TypeScript errors that will resolve once dependencies are installed:

- [ ] **Run `cd ui && npm install`** to install React dependencies
- [ ] **Add React types**: Already included in package.json, should resolve with npm install

### 3. Test the System

- [ ] **Start services**: `make live-dev`
- [ ] **Start test publisher**: `make test-publisher` 
- [ ] **Open browser**: http://localhost:5173
- [ ] **Verify audio works**: Click "Start Audio" and hear musical events

### 4. Deploy to Your Lovable Domain

Choose one approach:

#### Option A: Frontend Only (Easiest)
- [ ] **Build React app**: `cd ui && npm run build`
- [ ] **Upload ui/dist/ to Lovable hosting**
- [ ] **Configure environment variables** in Lovable dashboard
- [ ] **Setup external backend** (VPS/cloud server for API + Redis)

#### Option B: Full Stack (if Lovable supports Docker)
- [ ] **Deploy entire Docker Compose setup** to Lovable
- [ ] **Configure production environment variables**

## üéØ Optional Enhancements

### Phase 2 Improvements

- [ ] **Add msgpack support** to React client for binary WebSocket efficiency
- [ ] **Implement user authentication** for WebSocket connections
- [ ] **Add audio visualizations** (waveform, frequency analysis)
- [ ] **Implement recording/playback** of live sessions
- [ ] **Add mobile responsiveness** optimizations

### Phase 3 Future Features

- [ ] **Mobile app** (React Native + Expo)
- [ ] **Multi-user sessions** with shared listening
- [ ] **Advanced audio effects** (3D spatial audio, granular synthesis)
- [ ] **ML anomaly detection** for enhanced musical triggers
- [ ] **Voice alerts** with AI-generated insights

## üêõ Known Issues to Address

### TypeScript Errors
- **Status**: Will resolve with `npm install`
- **Files**: `ui/src/App.tsx`, `ui/src/main.tsx`
- **Cause**: Missing React type definitions

### Docker Compose Optimizations
- [ ] **Add health checks** for all services
- [ ] **Optimize build caching** for faster rebuilds
- [ ] **Add development vs production** compose file variants

### Testing Coverage
- [ ] **Add integration tests** for full WebSocket flow
- [ ] **Add frontend unit tests** for React components
- [ ] **Add load testing** for WebSocket scaling
