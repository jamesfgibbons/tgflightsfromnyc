Peak travel times, such as summer and major holidays (e.g., Christmas, Thanksgiving), can increase fares significantly. Basic economy fares often include only a personal item, while standard fares may include a carry-on and checked bag. For example, a fare of $600 might be found 30 days out during a non-peak period, while a fare could rise to $1000 during the holiday season.\"\n}"
